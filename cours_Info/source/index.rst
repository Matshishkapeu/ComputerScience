Computer science for engineers
==============================

This course has the vocation to help the student to developp his basics skills in computer science.

* The first section is an introduction to logic. The student will learn the concept of propositional language and its application to logical circuits that constitute basics components of informatics complex systems.
* The second section will introduce computer architecture concepts. It includes mother board, microcontrollers and processors descriptions. Registers, adresses and data management are detailed at the low scale.
* In the third section, algorithm concepts are developped.
* The fourth section is dedicated to the transcription of algorithms in computer langage C/C++.
* In the fifth section, the student will apply the preceding concepts on the electronics plateform Arduino_.
* The sixth and last section is devoted to data treatment using python_ programming language.
